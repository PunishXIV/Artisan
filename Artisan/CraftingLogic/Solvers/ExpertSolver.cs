// some thoughts:
// - any time we want to regain some dura, we can bait pliant and use manip
// - assuming 12% pliant, 3% good, 12% good omen, average cost to get pliant from random starting point is ~24cp
// - this means that estimated manip cost is 24+48 = 72, meaning 10dura is worth ~18cp
// - if we were to use full cost manip as a rule, it would be worth ~24cp instead - but we should rarely be doing that
// - if we start in some non-interesting state, we would need to pay ~31cp to get pliant (because we pay 7cp to start from 'random' state)
// repair actions:
// - if we get random pliant and manip is not active, using manip is effectively winning 24cp (because we don't need to bait), which is the baseline worth of pliant
// - using pliant mm is getting 30dura = 54cp for 44cp, meaning it's effective 10cp win
// - using pliant manip to clip 1 stack is getting 35dura = 63cp for 48cp, meaning it's effective 15cp win, making it better than mm
// - using pliant manip to clip 2 stacks is getting 30dura = 54cp for 48cp, meaning is's 8cp win compared to 10cp mm - which makes sense, as it's a strict loss
// - primed manip is free 10dura = 18cp for full cost, meaning it's ~30cp more expensive than pliant; observing would be ~31cp, meaning generally pliant is an ok alternative
// assuming 60dura craft, the real dura sweet spot is exactly 25dura
// - any more and we can't use manip+mm on double pliant
// - any less and we might be forced to use observe and waste conditions
// - so general flow is - exploit buffs (mume/vene/inno), outside buffs get manip and get to sweet spot before starting next phase, exploit random procs for iq/progress if while waiting
// synth action comparison
// - basic synth is 120p for 18cp = 6.67p/cp - baseline to finish the craft
// - careful synth is 180p for 7+18cp = 7.2p/cp - slightly more efficient way to finish the craft
// - prudent synth is 180p for 18+9cp = 6.67p/cp -  alternative way to finish the craft, with different cp/durability cost spread
// - observe+focused synth is 200p for 7+5+18cp = 6.67p/cp - TODO consider, might be a good way to exploit malleable?.. good all around, too bad we have better actions
// - groundwork is 360p for 18+36cp = 6.67p/cp - very expensive durability wise, TODO consider for veneration/waste-not utilization?
// - rapid synth is 500p for 18cp with 50% success (75% under centered) = 13.89p/cp (20.83p/cp under centered) - this is extremely efficient and thus is our baseline
// - intensive synth is 400p for 6+18cp = 16.67p/cp (9.09p/cp if we assume good is worth 20cp) - very efficient, good alternative to rapid if gamble is undesired, uses up good condition
// touch action comparison
// - basic touch combo is 1iq + 100/125/150p for 18+18cp = 2.78/3.47/4.17p/cp - too restrictive for reacting to procs, too inefficient if broken, maybe useful under waste-not?..
// - hasty touch is 100p for 1iq + 18cp with 60% success (85% under centered) = 3.33p/cp (4.72p/cp under centered) - decent way to exploit centered/sturdy for iq
// - observe+focused touch is 1iq + 150p for 7+18+18cp = 3.49p/cp - this is a baseline for finisher phase, very good opportunity to react for procs
// - prep touch is 2iq + 200p for 40+36cp = 2.63p/cp - very expensive and not very efficient, but still the best quality action, so decent to exploit good/sturdy for quality if under gs+inno
// - precise touch is 2iq + 150p for 18+18cp = 4.17p/cp (2.67p/cp if we assume good is worth 20cp) - very efficient way of getting iq, and decent way to exploit good for quality under gs/inno
// - prudent touch is 1iq + 100p for 25+9cp = 2.94p/cp - very efficient way of getting iq, and a reasonable alternative for finisher when low on dura
// - finnesse is 100p for 32cp = 3.13p/cp - even better alternative for finisher when low on dura, quite expensive cp wise though
// general flow
// - if starting with mume, use buff for rapid/intensive, and potentially use vene for some more free progress
// -- one concern here is using too much dura here and being forced to bait for pliant and waste good conditions
// - after mume (or from start, if not using it), aim for progress and iq
// -- if low on dura, observe on useless conditions to preserve dura and bait pliant
// -- if high on dura and need more progress, consider vene + rapid spam
// - after reaching 10iq, focus on quality instead - use gs/inno combos
// -- consider what to do with progress: either force finish before starting quality (wastes good opportunities like centered later between combos) or just start quality combos immediately (harder to estimate needed cp to finish the craft)
// - after reaching quality cap, just get progress
